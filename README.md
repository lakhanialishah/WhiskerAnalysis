# WhiskerAnalysis

WhiskerAnalysis provides all the code for the analysis in the following paper: 

Scripts provide examples of code for raw data (TDT software) to Matlab conversion, extracting waveforms from Kilosort/Phy output, and current source density (CSD) analysis. Functions in the folder titled 'Single Unit Analysis' provides the code used in the script 'final_script.m'. The 'stim_matrices_for_each data' variable contains all information for the mouse recorded from that day, including stimulation matrices, best whisker (BW), columnar whisker (CW), probe location, and experimental condition.
